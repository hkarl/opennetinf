In this directory you can build OpenNetinf via ANT. To do so, please follow these steps:

1) copy settings to ~/.netinf  (e.g. /home/netinf/.netinf/settings)
2) adjust settings in ~/.netinf/settings
3) start ant here
4) go to dist/scripts and run configure.sh

Alternatively, you can use the script build.sh which will use standard settings for ~/.netinf/settings
if no such file is present
