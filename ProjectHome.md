# Open Network of Information Prototype #

This is a prototype of a new, information-centric Internet architecture called the **Network of Information (NetInf)**. The development of this prototype is driven by the University of Paderborn (Germany), led by [Christian Dannewitz](http://www.cs.uni-paderborn.de/fachgebiete/fachgebiet-rechnernetze/people/dipl-inf-christian-dannewitz.html).

This prototype is based on work performed in the **European FP7 projects [4WARD](http://www.4ward-project.eu) and [SAIL](http://www.sail-project.eu)**.

More information about the NetInf architecture and the underlying concepts can be found at http://www.netinf.org.

A **documentation**, containing information about the technical concepts and the usage of the prototype can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/opennetinf/downloads/detail?name=NetInf_documentation_Sep-2011.pdf).
